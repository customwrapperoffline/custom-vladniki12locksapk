    "level13_intro_0": "We'll start the show without delay!",
    "level13_intro_1": "We locked Mum in this cupboard",
    "level13_intro_2": "Let's see if she can get out of there!",

    "level17_end_1": "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!",

    "level18_intro_0": "Today we decided to do some sports!",
    "level18_intro_1": "What's in that locker, Vlad?",
    "level18_intro_2": "I don't know. Shall we open it and see?",
    "level18_intro_3": "Let's, but first we'll have to unlock all these locks",
    "level18_end_0": "Here's the locker open!",

    "level20_end_1": "Wow! It's very cozy!",
    "level20_end_2": "Yes, there is even a stone TV!",

    "level21_intro_0": "What's this thing, Vlad?",
    "level21_intro_1": "I don't know, but I think we'd better not press anything here",
    "level21_intro_2": "Oops! I think I pressed something",
    "level21_intro_3": "Woah! We're shrinking!",
    "level21_intro_4": "How can we get big again?",
    "level21_intro_5": "I think we'll find a solution behind this door",
